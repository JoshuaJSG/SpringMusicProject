#How to use project

####Steps

    1. Once project is being ran, either through it being cloned or through launching the application from a .jar file.
    If you decide to run a .jar file, run the command "java -jar <APPLICATION_NAME.jar> in your terminal. If you decide to clone the project, you can run it as normal in your own integrated development environment.
     go to your browser and search localhost:8080/artists
    2. Choose one of the following examples
       Get artists localhost:8080/artists "This displays all artists"
       Get by id localhost:8080/artists/1 "This gets an artist by their id"
       Post a new artist localhost:8080/artists "This adds a new artist"
       Updates an artist localhost:8080/artists "This updates an artist by name and songs".
       

Note: In order to POST and PUT data you must use your own software to do so, a few options are: Postman or Insomnia.
 This will allow you to test to see if your http requests are working correctly to my distributed database.
