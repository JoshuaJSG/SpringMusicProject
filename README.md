#How to use project
This project currently uses a testDAO which has test data that is displayed once localhost:8080 is ran.
This project will use data persisted to a database in the near future.

Steps

    1. Once project is being ran, go to your browser and search localhost:8080/artists
    2. Choose one of the following examples
       Get artists localhost:8080/artists "This displays all artists"
       Get by id localhost:8080/artists/1 "This gets an artist by their id"
       

Update and delete will be completed soon
